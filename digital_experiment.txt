Experiment Overview
====================
Objective: To determine if a new "Recommended Articles" feature increases user engagement on a news website.

Hypothesis: The new "Recommended Articles" feature will increase user engagement (measured by the number of articles read per session) compared to the existing feature.

Metrics:
- Primary Metric: Number of articles read per session
- Secondary Metrics: Session duration, click-through rate on recommended articles

Target Audience: Users visiting the website from any device

Experiment Design
==================
Groups:
- Control Group: Users who see the existing "Recommended Articles" feature
- Test Group: Users who see the new "Recommended Articles" feature

Sample Size: 10,000 users (5,000 in each group)

Duration: 2 weeks

Implementation
==============
1. Random Assignment:
   Use a randomization mechanism to assign users to either the control group or the test group. This can be done using a simple random number generator or a more sophisticated service if available (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).

2. Tracking User Engagement:
   Implement tracking to measure the number of articles read per session, session duration, and click-through rates. This can be done using Google Analytics or any other web analytics tool.

3. Feature Implementation:
   - Control Group: Display the existing "Recommended Articles" feature.
   - Test Group: Display the new "Recommended Articles" feature.

Code Example
============
Below is a simplified example using JavaScript to randomly assign users to groups and display the appropriate feature. We'll assume a function trackEngagement exists to log user interactions.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>News Website</title>
    <script>
        // Function to randomly assign users to control or test group
        function getGroup() {
            return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test';
        }

        // Function to initialize the experiment
        function initExperiment() {
            const userGroup = getGroup();
            if (userGroup === 'control') {
                displayControlFeature();
            } else {
                displayTestFeature();
            }
            trackEngagement(userGroup);
        }

        // Function to display the control feature
        function displayControlFeature() {
            document.getElementById('recommended-articles').innerHTML = `
                <h2>Recommended Articles</h2>
                <!-- Existing feature content -->
            `;
        }

        // Function to display the test feature
        function displayTestFeature() {
            document.getElementById('recommended-articles').innerHTML = `
                <h2>Recommended Articles</h2>
                <!-- New feature content -->
            `;
        }

        // Function to track user engagement
        function trackEngagement(group) {
            // Implement tracking logic here (e.g., Google Analytics events)
            console.log(`User assigned to: ${group}`);
        }

        // Initialize the experiment when the page loads
        window.onload = initExperiment;
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content">
        <h1>Welcome to the News Website</h1>
        <div id="recommended-articles"></div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Data Analysis
=============
1. Collect Data:
   Gather data on the primary and secondary metrics for both the control and test groups over the duration of the experiment.

2. Analyze Results:
   Use statistical methods to compare the metrics between the two groups. Common methods include t-tests for comparing means and chi-squared tests for proportions.

3. Interpret Results:
   Determine if the differences in user engagement between the control and test groups are statistically significant and whether they support the hypothesis.

Conclusion
==========
Based on the analysis, decide whether to roll out the new "Recommended Articles" feature to all users or to continue with further testing. This decision should be based on the observed impact on user engagement and any other relevant business considerations.
